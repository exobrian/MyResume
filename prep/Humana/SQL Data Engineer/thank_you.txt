Hi Chaz!

I just wanted to say thank you so much for your time yesterday. It was really great to hear about how many company hats you wear day to day, from developer to analyst and everything in between for so many sectors. It sounded parallel to my own experiences (even the transition to scrum was similar) and made me feel comfortable to be able to relate on some level.

It seems like Enclara Pharmacia has some great goals ahead and you all are going to be busy for a while. However this goes, I wish you the best of luck in your searching!

You and Tyrone sound like great people to work with. Hopefully we'll run into each other again, but in the meantime please let me know if there's any additional information I can provide for you all.

Thanks and take care!

Brian Tran
