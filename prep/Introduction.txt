I'm Brian.
I'm currently a mid level Actuarial Analyst at ICW where I also volunteer my time as a software engineer on our development team. 

I have a background in Applied Math from Calpoly. I was drawn to the actuarial science field because of the challenge from the exams.

I became an actuarial analyst at ICW where I picked programming and development skills to automate and modernize most of my work. While passing my exams and working my way up the ladder, I discovered my real passion was in software development. So that leads me here :)
